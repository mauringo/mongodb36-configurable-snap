    MongoDB is a high-performance, open source, schema-free
    document-oriented data store that's easy to deploy, manage
    and use. It's network accessible, written in C++ and offers
    the following features:

       * Collection oriented storage - easy storage of object-style data
       * Full index support, including on inner objects
       * Query profiling
       * Replication and fail-over support
       * Efficient storage of binary data including large objects (e.g. videos)
       * Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability

    High performance, scalability, and reasonable depth of functionality
    are the goals for the project.
